<h2>December 2019 - Janurary 2020</h2>
<div class="content">
  Minimal version of a 22 day, 2800 mile road trip from Chicago to Hilton Head and back.
</div>

<h4>Day 1 - West Lafayette and Indianapolis</h4>
<div class="content">
  Every 4-5 years, my employer sets us free for one month to ... I suppose think about life. Since it would include traveling with 2 young children, Dana and I decided that we spend the month road tripping to warmer weather. Driving no more than 4 hours any day, stopping at the great sights on our way to the South.
  On the first day, we left after rush hour in Chicago and only had time to each lunch in West Lafayette and see the campus a little bit because there was a blizzard in Central Indiana. We saw a bunch of trucks sliding off the road but Sharon (our beloved Saburu) managed to AWD herself without incident to the Chicken farm we were staying at.

<h4>Day 2,3 - Louisville, Park City, KY, and Mammomth Cave NP</h4>
<div class="content">
  The 2nd day started with packing up and driving to Louisville. I guess the special food in Louisville is the "Hot Brown" which is just an open face turkey sandwich with some Hollandaise sauce. Googling the best Hot Brown lead me to Wild Yolk.
  Then we spent some time playing in Louisville's Ohio riverfront playground before driving to where we were staying that night in Park City, KY. We were staying in a dairy farm that night!
  <img src="dairyfarm.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  We learned that the dairy farm was once owned by a Amish family. After a good night's sleep, we headed off the Mammoth Cave National Park. I was initially a bit hesitant to go on a cave tour with 2 wild children, but we signed them up for the Frozen Niagra tour and they ended up behaving great! It's too bad most of my photo from the caves didn't come out.
  However, in order to protect the caves, the NPS also has to protect the surrounding lands -- which means some pretty fun hikes, including this one where the river Styx, an underwater river, meets the Green River, a surface river.

</div>

<div class="content">
  Farm is probably the best place to stay with children. While we were cleaning up to move on to our next destination, we just told the kids to go out and terrorize the chicken, goats, and cows. They were looked after by a shepard dog named "Mac" and tired themselves out before we departed.

<h4>Day 4,5 - Mammoth Cave NP, Obed Wild and Scenic River to Oak Ridge, Seymour TN, and Smoky Mountains NP</h4>
<div class="content">
  This was going to be the longest leg of our driving so we decided to price in some stops to make it more enjoyable. One of the stops we wanted to hit up was the Obed Wild and Scenic River. I mindlessly punched it into my Google machine and it decided to take me down a regrettable back alley of Kentucky. So I backtracked to "Clear River" and found this nice picnic spot.
  Dana even got to start a campfire here.

</div>

<div class="content">
  After this pit stop, we decided to goto Oak Ridge because it was suppose to be a Manhattan Project work site where 74,000 people lived and worked on building the atomic bomb. However, it turned out to be just a historic site which shares a building with a children's museum, but a shitty one at that. So I left them in the "chicken room" and went to go check out the Manhattan Project exhibits.

<div class="content">
  Erin, Dana's sister met up with us that evening which was great because now the 2 kid's attention are spread across 3 adults. The next morning, we headed to Smoky Mountain NP. Unexpectedly, it is next to a insane tourist attraction called "Dollywood," which is basically the Southern Country music version of DisneyWorld. Anyways, December is their off-season so it wasn't insane, but I
  can imagine how it would completely insane during the summers. We managed to somehow convince the kids to go on 2 hikes at Smoky Mountain, totaling ~3.6 miles. This picture is from the hike to Cataract Falls.

<div class="content">
  The greatest part of finally getting to Tennesse was that it was finally over 50 degrees!
  <img src="cataractfalls.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  Then the 2.6 mile roundtrip hike to Laurel Falls, which both kids walked both ways?! Tennesse was full of strange wonders, Dollywood, Pigeon Forge, Gatlinburg gave me a positive impression of this place. The Airbnb we stayed at, however, left me really angry. The place was actually beautiful as it sits on top of a mountain. But then, I was awoken at night to the sound of mice scampering around; in the morning, I realized that there was mice droppings all over the place.

<h4>Day 6,7 - Asheville, NC</h4>
<div class="content">
  After a struggle of comprenhending a mice infested house, we continued onto Asheville. In Asheville we met up with Heather and did a "auntie swap." Erin went on her way back home to host her parents, but Heather came and stayed with us on her way from DC. Asheville is probably one of the trendier southern towns. We also did a hike in Bent Creek, which appears to be a mountain biking hotspot. Later on that day I finally got to get in one of my runs -- felt good to run for the first time after being on the road for so long. One great thing about NC is that it's finally far south enough where some of the trees were still green. At Bent Creek, Heather was sad she didn't get to swing across the river with the rest of us cause her arm was still bummed from Berlin.

<h4>Day 8-12 - Christmas in Columbia, SC</h4>
<div class="content">
  Leaving Asheville, we continued onto Columbia, where we'll be spending Christmas. This is where my brother-in-law David is stationed. Not a lot happened here, as it was a bit of a breaktime from driving so much. This is where I did the most running -- which is great. The best run I had was probably at Congaree National Park. The park itself is a swamp but also it's been raining a lot -- to the point where the Park Ranger told me it was basically impassable but feel free to try. Of course, I had to try. So I ran/waded through the swamp to finish the trail. I later learned there's all kinds of interesting things in the water -- including alligators -- but too late now.

<div class="content">
  I thought this picture was funny, as the kids were wondering why I was in the swamp. But clearly the trail marker is there on the tree.
  <img src="kids.jpeg" alt="" style="width:50%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  For the most part in Columbia, we just ate, opened presents, and worked out a lot. I even got to go lift at a gym at Fort Jackson. It was 70 degrees and sunny most of the days so it was unseasonably nice too. Here, David and Erin are giving the kids a paddleboat ride at Sesquicentennial State Park.
  <img src="columbiapark.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  And V got to play with a little girl at Poinsett State Park -- which had an abandoned mill that the kids liked. This park also featured some giant Loblolly Pine Trees
  <img src="poinsett.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<h4>Day 13-17 - Hilton Head, SC</h4>
<div class="content">
  After the Dana's mom and dad left, we drove to Hilton Head. This was probably the warmest part of our vacation. Right when we got there, Ducky was ready to go dig a hole on the beach.
  <img src="hhday1.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  On the 2nd day, we went to check out Savannah, which was cool city. We ate in a really old diner away from the river and the hostess was seriously the most lovable person ever. The day was going fine, and we decided to stop at a playground...
  <img src="savannah.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  ... that's when V decided to bash in her face into a slide and completely fractured her front teeth. Dana and I took her to a pediatric dentist in Bluffton called Coastal Pediatric Dentistry and they were some of the nicest people. They gave her some laughing gas, fixed her up, and V ate ice cream for the next 12 hours.
  <img src="pediatricdentistry.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  The next morning, I ran 7 miles on the beach and got to my goal of running 1000 miles in 2019. Afterwards, we drove to "Harbourtown" which was basically the bourgeois class' version of Hilton Head. Somehow they managed to create a place where it cost $8 just to drive in. In addition, the place is just full of your country club types -- completely not my style. However, one nice point is that Sea Pines Forest Preserve is there and it has a nice short walk for the kids. We then spent the afternoon back on the beach exploring the puddles left behind by the low tide/
  <img src="puddles.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  On new years day, we decided to goto Fish Haul Park where apparently people find shark teeth all the time. We didn't find any, but the kids still had fun.
  <img src="sharkteeth.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<h4>Day 18 - Macon and Atlanta</h4>
<div class="content">
  After spending the morning being awoken by Heather leaving at 5 a.m., we said goodbye to the beach and started our long journey back to Chicago. Our first stop was Macon to get some "real" Southern food in Macon, GA. It was not that great. However, a real highlight of Macon was Ocmulgee Mounds -- an ancient Native American mound. That night, we tried a Comfort Suites cause there weren't any airbnbs near there and I completely forgot what a nightmare the "continental breakfast" is -- it's a toddler paradise though.

<h4>Day 19, 20 - Chattanooga</h4>
<div class="content">
  On the way North, there were a ton of civil war battlefield sites. One of the 2 sites we were to was Chickamauga National Military Park.
  <img src="chickamauga.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  Chattanooga turned out to be one of the most livable cities we have visited. It is incredibly outdoorsy: It has a 13 mile riverfront trail and a site to rent kayaks and canoes on the Tennesse River. There's even a hotel named the Chattanooga Choo Choo where you can stay in the train cars. Unfortunately our first day in Chattanooga was incredibly rainy and we just wanted a warm bowl of Pho.
  <img src="chattanoogachoochoo.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  The next day was sunny and we took advantage with a jam packed day. I started the day by running a good portion of the river trail. It was really nice. Even though it was cloudy morning, there were tons of people out running. Next, we went to the International Towing & Recovery Museum. Okay that sounds really stupid but it was actually really nice.
  <img src="tow.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  Next, we did a hike at Falling Water Falls. It's a bit dangerous. To the right of this photo is a waterfall cliff...
  <img src="fallingfalls.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<h4>Day 21 Nashville and Paducah, KY</h4>
<div class="content">
  Our final overnight stay was at Paducah. This region is the meeting point between the Teneessee, Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers -- thus, lots of barges. I describe it as sort of the Turkey of the US since before planes, it was a militarily strategic location. Hence, even more civil war sites.
  <img src="stoneriver.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  We then had lunch with my old pal Laura in Nashville in a pizza resturant that also has a play place (Why have they not brought this to Chicago?!) And continued onto Paducah. Paducah was a booming metropolis ... in the 40's. It's trying to redefine itself as a theatre and arts town. Regardless, the population has since dwindled but it was still an interesting town full of relics of when it was booming. Such as this train with a art deco poster that says "Welcome to Atomic City!"
  <img src="paducah.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
</div>

<div class="content">
  By the way, that wall where that mural was painted was to prevent the water from the river from coming into the city. There are these massive metal gates and concrete walls to hold the water back. Apparently every spring the town floods. We are well on the way there now:

<h4>Day 22 Crab Orchard National Wildlife and Champaign</h4>
<div class="content">
  After spending the night in a crappy airbnb we continued back into Illinois. Southern Illinois is actually really beautiful but we didn't want to stop so early on our final 6 hour drive into the City. So we chose Crab Orchard Preserve to stop at. Supposdly Janurary is Bald Eagle spotting season there. We talked to one of the most helpful park rangers and even borrowed a pair of binoculars from her. No Eagles were spotted

<div class="content">
  We began this roadtrip the same way we ended it -- at a college campus. This time in a place I lived 4 years and made many friends at: U of I. Champaign isn't what it used to be, a dumpy corn town, but now actually a building full of high rises. Luckily, my favorite $5 pizza still survived -- it's still $5 -- Za's. We made it home that night around 8pm and I've already started planning my next Adventure.
